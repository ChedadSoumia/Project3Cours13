# Project3Cours13
A simple Stack implementation in C++ using inheritance from a Queue class. This project demonstrates how to reuse the queueâ€™s underlying list structure to implement a stack (LIFO) by inserting elements at the beginning. It includes basic operations such as push, pop, Top, and Bottom.
